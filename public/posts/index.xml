      <description>Problem I was trying to get BittorrentSync set up on my home server running Centos 6.6, but the BTSync site is set up strangely and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t copy the download link in order to do a quick wget on my server. So that leaves me with the tar.gz on my laptop.
Attempts Ok I have a few ways to proceed. My first inclination was scp that tarball over to my server and go from there.</description>
