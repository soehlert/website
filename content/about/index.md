My dog Jackson laying in bed smiling

I find downtime boring and a life without creating to be lacking. I'll also try anything twice. 

+ This means I love to do things like play music (poorly); drums, piano, guitar, bass, ukulele, harmonica and making my own [electronic music](https://soundcloud.com/soehlert)

+ I've dabbled with painting, drawing, and copper etching as a form of art

+ I like to build things mostly out of wood, though I've also recently begun welding

+ I also love nothing more than playing soccer. Getting outdoors to go hiking is pretty great, too

+ Traveling the world and seeing how other people live is one of my favorite ways to improve as a person

+ I also spend too much time reading about new technology and playing around in my homelab
